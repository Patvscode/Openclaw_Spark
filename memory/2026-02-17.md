## Major Model Switch: Opus → Sonnet 4
- Pat requested switch to save money at 3:54 PM
- Changed from anthropic/claude-opus-4-6 to anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
- Also switched morning-briefing cron from Opus to FLASH (local, free)
- Now ZERO Anthropic costs except our conversations — all crons run local

## Qwen 3.5 Discovery
- **MAJOR**: Qwen 3.5 released Feb 16 (yesterday) — just found it
- 397B total params, only 17B active per task = 8x performance, 60% lower cost
- Built for "agentic AI era" with autonomous task execution
- Available on HuggingFace: Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B
- **Not on Ollama yet** — too new, probably weeks away

## AI-Scientist Scaled to 2 Pipelines
- **Goal**: Scale 2 Tue → 3 Wed → max Thu (Pat's original plan)
- **Pipeline #1**: nanoGPT (PID 563577, running since Feb 15) — 5 experiments completed
- **Pipeline #2**: grokking (PID 804866, launched 4:53 PM) — analyzing mathematical reasoning
- Both use qwen3-coder, share GPU 0
- Monitor updated to track both pipelines via FLASH (free)

## AI-Scientist Monitor Fixed
- Was failing since ~1 PM (couldn't execute ps/ls commands)
- Updated to track both pipelines, runs hourly via FLASH
- Zero Anthropic cost

## Research Server via Tailscale
- Pat requested research export at 5:09 PM
- Set up HTTP server: 100.109.173.109:8080 (Tailscale only, private)
- Serves all AI-Scientist results, papers, plots from both pipelines
- Python3 simple server (PID 806050) at /tmp/research-export/

## Key Insights from FLASH Research
- JetPack 7.1 (Jan 2026) supports generative AI + humanoid robotics at edge
- Caterpillar using Jetson Thor for autonomous heavy industry robots
- Recursive self-improvement papers emerging (Medium, DAIR.AI)
- OLMo 32B by AI2 is recent open-source release (truly open)

## Current Active Processes
- AI-Scientist Pipeline #1: PID 563577 (nanoGPT, running 2+ days)
- AI-Scientist Pipeline #2: PID 804866 (grokking, launched today)
- Research HTTP server: PID 806050 (Tailscale 8080)
- VNC server: serving 100.109.173.109:5900 (password: sparkVNC!)
