# 2026-02-13 — Day Two

## Morning/Afternoon Session

### OpenAI Fallback Key
- Pat provided OpenAI key: sk-proj-AQS5M3t2...n4_MA
- Attempted to configure as fallback model (Opus primary → GPT-4o fallback → local 120B)
- Config patch failed with "invalid config" — need to figure out correct auth profile format
- Still TODO

### Voice Messages Working
- Transcribed Pat's voice via OpenAI Whisper API (skill: openai-whisper-api)
- TTS working — sent voice notes back via Telegram (asVoice: true on message tool)
- Pat wants Sesame AI CSM voice model set up locally, specifically the **Maya voice** (female)
- Pat wants ALL agents to be able to use it (Spark, Bob, mini models)

### Sesame CSM Setup (Bob's work)
- Bob cloned https://github.com/SesameAILabs/csm to ~/.openclaw/workspace-bob/csm/
- CSM-1B: 1B param voice model, Apache 2.0, needs GPU ≥8GB VRAM
- Compatible with DGX Spark (ARM64 + CUDA 12 + unified memory)
- Real-time factor ~0.6x (faster than real-time)
- Bob wrote run_csm.py with conversation generation script
- STILL NEEDS: PyTorch ARM64+CUDA wheels, HuggingFace login, model weight download, test run
- Research doc at: workspace-bob/findings/2026-02-13-sesame-ai-voice.md

### Bob Has Been Very Productive
- Cron jobs (set up by someone — not me) have been running Bob on research tasks
- 25+ research findings in workspace-bob/findings/ covering:
  - Self-improving AI architectures
  - Two-brain robot architectures  
  - Safety frameworks for RSI
  - Open source 6DOF arm surveys
  - DGX Spark + arm integration
  - Formal verification for self-improving AI
  - Latency/bandwidth for edge-cloud 6DOF
  - ROS2 integration
  - Benchmark suites
- Bob also built benchmark tools at workspace-bob/benchmark/
- These cron jobs are consuming Opus tokens (running under agent:main) — need to investigate and possibly clean up

### Cron Jobs Discovered
- Multiple cron jobs running: mini-2-beta through mini-8-hotel, bob-autonomous-worker
- All using claude-opus-4-6 model = burning paid API tokens
- There's also an agent "mini-1" (Alpha) running gpt-oss:20b on Telegram account "alpha"
- Pat tried /alpha command — it's a separate agent that didn't respond
- NEED TO: audit and clean up these crons to save money

### Spark Hub Updates
- Electron main process written (electron-main.js)
- electron + electron-builder installed as dev deps
- Pat wants Electron app + web dashboard paired/synced
- Spark Hub systemd service keeps dying (killed multiple times) — needs investigation

### Rate Limiting
- Hit 30k input tokens/min limit repeatedly
- Pat bought more API tokens (increased plan)
- Still need to wire token pacer into actual API flow
- Pat suggested distributing load across agents

### Brave Search Configured
- API key: BSARrY6emfcU0epucdBIftR_LDMnCdw
- Configured via tools.web.search in gateway config
- Both Spark and Bob can now use web_search

### Alpha Agent
- mini-1 agent exists, running gpt-oss:20b, on Telegram account "alpha"
- Pat messaged it via /alpha, didn't get response
- Need to investigate its setup

## Open Items
1. Finish Sesame CSM installation (PyTorch wheels, HF login, test)
2. Configure OpenAI fallback properly
3. Audit/clean cron jobs burning Opus tokens
4. Finish Electron app packaging
5. Wire token pacer into API flow
6. Investigate Alpha agent
7. Switch to Maya voice once Sesame is working
