# 2026-02-13 — Day 2

## Cron Job Audit
- Discovered all 15 cron jobs had `agentId: "main"` — burning Opus tokens for local-model tasks
- Fix in progress: update agentId to "bob"/"mini" per job, delete duplicate mini-1/2/3 entries
- Cron API supports `update` (patch with jobId) and `remove` (jobId)

## Multi-Agent Expansion
- Mini agents (mini-1 through mini-8) configured: gpt-oss:20b via Ollama, staggered cron schedules (twice/hour each)
- Alpha agent (mini-1-alpha) paired with separate Telegram account — not responding to Pat's messages (blocked/investigating)
- Duplicates exist for mini-1-alpha, mini-2-beta, mini-3-gamma — need deletion

## Sesame CSM Voice
- Bob cloned repo to workspace-bob/csm/, wrote run_csm.py
- Blocked on: PyTorch ARM64+CUDA wheels, HuggingFace login, model weight download
- Target voice: Maya (female)

## Spark Hub
- Redesigned with sidebar nav, dark theme, 4 pages (Dashboard, Tasks, Bob's Workbench, Settings)
- Electron deps installed, electron-main.js written but not built/tested
- Token pacer module exists at lib/token-pacer.js but NOT wired into actual API throttling
- systemd service enabled, auto-restarts on crash

## OpenAI Fallback
- Pat provided OpenAI key for Whisper + fallback routing
- config.patch attempt failed with "invalid config" — needs retry with correct schema

## Bob Reliability
- Bob fails to save output files to requested paths (happened with orbit research + sesame notes)
- Needs investigation/workaround

## Security
- chmod 700 on ~/.openclaw/credentials (was world-readable)

## Swarm Architecture Implemented
- Fixed agentId on all cron jobs: Bob's 3 jobs → "bob", Alpha → "mini-1", git backup → "bob"
- Deleted duplicate disabled git-backup cron
- Created Town Hall crons: morning (10am) + afternoon (4pm), Bob facilitates via 120B
- Created Emergency Health Check: every 15min, Delta (20b) checks Ollama/Spark Hub/disk/GPU/agent statuses
- Assigned role specializations to all minis:
  - Alpha: Swarm Lead | Beta: Documentarian | Gamma: QA/Peer Review
  - Delta: Health Monitor | Echo: Git Ops | Foxtrot: Frontend/UI
  - Golf: Research | Hotel: Backend/Infra
- Bumped Alpha's context window: 32K → 72K (73728) so it can synthesize across all minis
- Updated SWARM.md with Town Hall protocol, emergency response docs, and role specs
- Communication flow: minis write status → town hall reads all → Bob decides → escalations.md → Spark/Pat
- Afternoon town hall at 4pm today will be the FIRST one to fire

## Telegram Multi-Agent Setup
- Beta (@Betamini2bot), Gamma (@Gammamini3bot), Delta (@Deltamini4bot) bots created and configured
- All accounts added to config with bindings: beta→mini-2, gamma→mini-3, delta→mini-4
- Group privacy turned OFF via BotFather for all bots
- groupPolicy changed from "allowlist" to "open" for all accounts
- Pat created a "Town Hall" Telegram group with all bots added
- Still need tokens for: Echo (mini-5), Foxtrot (mini-6), Golf (mini-7), Hotel (mini-8)

## 20B Model Issues
- Minis leak internal reasoning into messages ("We need to check...", "Let's see...")
- Added "Output Rules" to all mini SOUL.md files to suppress this — partially effective
- Delta sometimes generates thinking but produces empty text response (stopReason: stop, no content)
- Can nudge stuck sessions via sessions_send to get them to respond
- Beta's SOUL.md and AGENTS.md rewritten with Documentarian role + clean output rules
- OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=3 means minis compete for GPU slots — responses can be slow when many fire at once

## Town Hall Group Chat
- Chat ID: -5195425739 (name: "TownHall" or similar)
- Active sessions: Spark (main), Alpha (mini-1), Beta (mini-2), Gamma (mini-3), Delta (mini-4)
- All bots confirmed receiving messages without @mentions
- Town Hall cron delivery set to "announce" so Pat gets summaries in Telegram

## Cron Job Fix — COMPLETED
- All Bob jobs: agentId → "bob" ✅
- Alpha job: agentId → "mini-1" ✅
- Git backup: agentId → "bob" ✅
- Duplicate disabled git-backup: deleted ✅
- Minis 2-8 cron jobs: updated with role-specific prompts ✅
- Note: minis 2-8 still use agentId "main" (no separate agent configs for them yet) but use local models via payload
