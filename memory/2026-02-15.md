# 2026-02-15 (Sunday)

## Morning/Afternoon: AI-Scientist Running Autonomously
- AI-Scientist pipeline running unattended for 2+ hours
- Completed experiments: adaptive_block_size (2 runs), layerwise_learning_rates, layerwise_gradient_normalization
- 5 result files across 3 experiments — productive autonomous run
- Using qwen3-coder model, NanoGPT shakespeare_char template

## Decision: Move Past Research Infrastructure
- Pat asked when research becomes redundant — agreed it's time to move on
- AI-Scientist runs autonomously in background (free GPU cycles) — no more active tinkering
- **ARA6D/CHUCK postponed 2 more weeks** — Pat's call
- Focus shifting to **agent delegation for real daily tasks** (option 3)

## Phase Plan: Making Ultimate Team Useful
- Phase 1 (this week): Morning briefing, research-on-demand, code generation pipeline
- Phase 2 (next week): Email triage, GitHub automation, knowledge base, smart reminders
- Phase 3 (week 2): Agent performance tracking, prompt refinement, overnight research digest

## Morning Briefing Cron Created
- Job: `morning-briefing` (id: ede7be70-e10a-4cbd-9237-b064406a1a3b)
- Schedule: 7:30 AM EST daily
- Covers: weather (Rochester NY), AI-Scientist results, Flash research, system health
- Runs as isolated agentTurn on main agent

## Blocked: Email/Calendar/GitHub Integration
- `gog` installed but **no OAuth configured** — needs Pat to provide client_secret.json
- `himalaya` installed but **no config** at ~/.config/himalaya/config.toml
- `gh` installed but **not authenticated** — needs `gh auth login`
- Once Pat sets these up, morning briefing gets email digest + calendar preview + GitHub activity

## AI-Scientist Monitor Cron
- Cron `ai-scientist-monitor` running and reporting status automatically
- Confirmed layerwise_gradient_normalization training (loss ~2.06, trending down)

## Active Cron Jobs (6 total now)
- morning-briefing (7:30 AM daily, main agent)
- ai-scientist-monitor (existing)
- flash-research-loop (3x daily, FLASH)
- bob-memory-maintenance, bob-findings-organizer, workspace-git-backup (Bob)
- daily-git-backup (main, has timeout issue — still unfixed)

## GitHub Authenticated
- `gh auth login` with PAT — account: Patvscode
- Morning briefing updated with GitHub notifications + activity

## Google OAuth Setup (In Progress)
- Pat created Google Cloud project: local-parsec-485806-h5
- client_secret.json saved to ~/.config/gog/client_secret.json (chmod 600)
- `gog auth credentials` loaded successfully — stored at ~/.config/gogcli/credentials.json
- **BLOCKED**: `gog auth add` needs browser OAuth — tried normal + `--manual` mode
- Manual mode gives URL + asks for redirect URL paste, but process keeps timing out
- Pat needs to complete OAuth from a browser that can reach localhost callback
- Client secret: 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 (in saved JSON)

## Anthropic Credits Ran Out (~5:30 PM)
- ai-scientist-monitor was burning ~30K tokens/run × every 30 min = ~1.4M tokens/day on Opus
- **Fixed**: Switched monitor to FLASH (local, free) + reduced to hourly
- Credits replenished by ~8:35 PM — Spark back online
- Only remaining Opus cron: morning-briefing (1x daily)

## FLASH Promoted to Coordinator
- Bound FLASH to Alpha Telegram bot (@Alphamini1bot)
- FLASH can now spawn: CODER, RUNNER, REASON, VISION
- Updated FLASH SOUL.md with coordinator role, team info, delegation instructions
- Pat will primarily talk to FLASH for free local work, Spark for complex stuff
- Config patched + gateway restarted (safe — no subagents running)

## Full Team Audit & Setup
- All 7 agent workspaces audited
- Created proper IDENTITY.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md for: FLASH, PRIME, CODER, REASON, RUNNER, VISION
- Bob already had proper files from earlier setup
- All SOUL.md files were already correct
- Pat requested this as "last thing before talking directly to FLASH"

## GitHub Authenticated
- `gh auth login` with PAT — account: Patvscode
- Scopes: repo, workflow, notifications, packages, etc.
- Morning briefing updated with GitHub notifications + activity
