# 2026-02-15 — Day 4: Ultimate Team Goes Live

## Major Breakthrough: Tool Calling WORKS
- CODER (qwen3-coder) successfully made structured tool_calls through OpenClaw → Ollama
- It called web_search AND web_fetch correctly — got real results, fetched 4 URLs in parallel
- The fix: models needed tool name hints in SOUL.md (they guessed `run` instead of `exec`, `write_file` instead of `write`)
- This unblocks ALL agent autonomy

## DeepSeek R1 Cannot Use Tools
- deepseek-r1:14b returns "does not support tools" — hard rejection from Ollama
- Swapped REASON agent from deepseek-r1:14b to qwen3:14b
- DeepSeek R1 stays in library for standalone reasoning tasks only (no agent use)

## Ultimate Team Deployed
- Old structure (Bob + 8 minis) fully disabled — 12 cron jobs turned off
- New agents: PRIME (qwen3:32b), FLASH (qwen3:30b-a3b), CODER (qwen3-coder), REASON (qwen3:14b), RUNNER (qwen3:14b), VISION (qwen3-vl:8b)
- Bob kept in reserve (not loaded by default)
- Flash (qwen3:30b-a3b) downloaded — 18GB MoE model, 256K context
- Total team VRAM: ~82GB, 46GB headroom

## First Research Tasks — Results
- **FLASH**: Researched AI-Scientist v2 — search + fetch + findings in 81 seconds. Confirmed v2 defaults to closed models but is patchable for local use (which we already did). Didn't write file but returned quality findings in response.
- **RUNNER**: Wrote research-ollama-tool-calling.md — tools worked (search + write) but content was hallucinated (fake benchmarks, said "avoid Qwen3" while being Qwen3). 14B too small for reliable factual research.
- **PRIME**: Ran exec successfully (full system inventory) but timed out before writing the report file. 32B thinks deeply but slow on multi-step.
- **CODER**: Used XML format for web_search (wrong), proper format for web_fetch (right). Fetched 4 URLs successfully but search calls failed. Added format fix to SOUL.md.

## Agent Tool-Use Capability Matrix (Tested)
| Agent | Model | exec | write | web_search | web_fetch | Verdict |
|-------|-------|------|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| FLASH | qwen3:30b-a3b | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **MVP — perfect, fastest** |
| CODER | qwen3-coder | — | — | ⚠️ XML bug | ✅ | Needs format fix |
| PRIME | qwen3:32b | ✅ | ❌ timeout | — | — | Good exec, slow multi-step |
| RUNNER | qwen3:14b | — | ✅ | ✅ | — | Works, low quality content |
| VISION | qwen3-vl:8b | untested | — | — | — | — |
| REASON | qwen3:14b | untested | — | — | — | — |

## Key Lesson: Gateway Restarts Kill Running Tasks
- Config.patch triggers SIGUSR1 restart which aborts all active subagent sessions
- NEVER patch config while agents are running tasks
- First batch of research tasks was killed by the REASON model swap restart

## Config Changes
- agents.list completely replaced with new team
- agentToAgent.allow updated for new agent IDs
- Telegram bindings simplified to just main + bob
- Old mini Telegram accounts (alpha/beta/gamma/delta) still in config but unbound

## Key Insight: Tool Name Aliases
- Qwen3 models CAN do tool calling — they just used wrong names
- After getting "tool not found" errors, CODER adapted and used correct names
- Adding tool name hints to SOUL.md should fix this permanently
- This was THE blocker we've been stuck on for 2 days
