# 2026-02-14 — Swarm v2 Launch

## All Models Downloaded ✅
14 models in Ollama library:
- qwen3:8b (5.2GB), qwen3:14b (9.3GB), qwen3:32b (20GB)
- qwen3-coder (18GB, MoE 30B-A3B), qwen3-vl:8b (6.1GB)
- deepseek-r1:14b (9GB), nomic-embed-text (274MB)
- gpt-oss:120b (65GB), gpt-oss:20b (13GB)
- qwen2.5:7b, qwen2.5vl:7b, llava, phi3

## Agent Model Upgrades Applied ✅
- Alpha: gpt-oss:20b → qwen3:14b (smarter coordinator)
- Beta-Hotel: gpt-oss:20b → qwen3:8b (all 7 workers)
- Bob: unchanged (gpt-oss:120b)
- Spark can now spawn ALL agents (not just bob + mini-1)
- All models registered in OpenClaw config

## All SOUL.md Files Rewritten ✅
- Alpha: Swarm coordinator, decisive, routes tasks
- Beta: Documentarian, clear writer
- Gamma: QA/Testing, skeptical, methodical
- Delta: Health monitor, vigilant but calm
- Echo: Git/DevOps, reliable, automation-first
- Foxtrot: Frontend/UI, creative but practical
- Golf: Research, curious and thorough
- Hotel: Backend, pragmatic engineer

## Self-Governance Framework Created
- comms/changelog.md — tracks all swarm modifications
- comms/performance-metrics.md — agent scoring template
- SWARM.md fully rewritten with v2 architecture
- Self-improvement loop: Monitor → Evaluate → Propose → Vote → Implement → Log
- Self-regulation rules: 3-fail escalation, GPU monitoring, task timeouts

## Boot Test Results (First Run on Qwen3)
- Alpha (14B): ✅ Booted, wrote status file, 3m15s
- Gamma (8B): ✅ Booted, but wrote template placeholders instead of real data
- Delta (8B): ✅ Booted, same template issue
- **Key finding**: Qwen3 agents understand tasks but don't properly invoke exec tool
- They describe/template what to do instead of running commands
- Fix needed: stronger "use the exec tool" prompting in SOUL.md or tool-use config tuning
- **Positive**: Zero reasoning leakage, 3x faster, coherent responses

## AI-Scientist Setup
- Repo at: ~/.openclaw/workspace-bob/AI-Scientist/
- Patched llm.py to support ollama/ model prefix (routes through OpenAI-compatible API)
- Added _OLLAMA_ACTIVE flag for proper code path routing
- Python 3.12 venv created (.venv/), torch+openai+anthropic+numpy installed ✅
- Still needs: texlive-full, template data prep, test run

## Bob's Telegram
- @BobOSS_bot configured and bound (account: "bob")
- Pat still needs to /start pair it and disable group privacy via BotFather

## Beta Tool-Use Test
- Spawned beta-tool-test with explicit "use the exec tool" instructions
- Result pending — will determine if prompting fix is sufficient
