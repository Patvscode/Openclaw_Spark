## Rate Limit Optimization
- Hit 30k input tokens/min limit on Opus (Anthropic API)
- Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md (no longer needed)
- Trimmed all workspace files: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, TOOLS.md
- Goal: reduce per-turn token overhead to stay under rate limits
- Next: route lightweight tasks to Bob, reduce heartbeat frequency
