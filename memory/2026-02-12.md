## Rate Limit Optimization
- Hit 30k input tokens/min limit on Opus (Anthropic API)
- Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md (no longer needed)
- Trimmed all workspace files: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, TOOLS.md
- Goal: reduce per-turn token overhead to stay under rate limits
- Set up GitHub backup: Patvscode/Openclaw_Spark
- Daily auto-backup cron at noon EST (runs via Bob, zero Opus cost)
- Added .gitignore for sensitive files
- Documented Bob delegation strategy in MEMORY.md
- Rate limit pipeline complete
- Built Bob's autonomous worker system: task queue + findings dir + cron every 30 min
- Seeded 3 initial research tasks (self-improving AI, 6-DOF arms, two-brain architectures)
- Bob self-directs: picks task → does it → writes findings → adds follow-ups
