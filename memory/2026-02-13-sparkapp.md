# 2026-02-13 — Spark App Build

## Swarm Build Results
Wave 1 (skeleton): Alpha(app.py/config.py), Hotel(models.py/db_setup.py), Foxtrot(HTML/CSS) — all delivered ~3 min
Wave 2 (APIs): Beta(status), Gamma(tasks), Delta(findings), Echo(training), Golf(JS) — all delivered ~3-5 min
Total: 13 files built by 8 minis in ~6 min parallel time

## Files Created
/workspace-swarm/projects/spark-app/src/
- app.py, config.py, models.py, db_setup.py, spark.db
- api/__init__.py, status.py, tasks.py, findings.py, training.py
- templates/dashboard.html, static/css/style.css, static/js/dashboard.js

## Integration Issues Found
- Hotel used relative imports (from .models) — fixed with sed
- db_setup.py only seeded 3 agents instead of 10 — Bob fixing
- app.py needs blueprint registration — Bob fixing
- Dashboard template needs JS/CSS includes — Bob fixing

## Bob Integration (in progress)
- Bob assigned to read all files, fix imports, register blueprints, seed all 10 agents, test app
- Expected ~6-10 min

## CSM-1B Voice (Sesame AI)
- Bob researched: CSM-1B, Apache 2.0, GitHub: SesameAILabs/csm, HuggingFace: sesame/csm-1b
- Runs on DGX Spark (needs 8GB+ VRAM, ARM64 compatible with right PyTorch wheels)
- Real-time capable (0.6x factor on consumer GPU)
- Pipeline: Whisper(STT) → Ollama(LLM) → CSM-1B(TTS)
- Repo cloned to /home/pmello/csm/, torch+torchaudio installed (2.10.0)
- Remaining deps install killed by OOM — retry when GPU free
- Needs HuggingFace token from Pat for model weights

## Spark App — RUNNING ✅
- Flask app serves at http://127.0.0.1:5000
- Dashboard HTML renders with dark theme
- Status API works (/api/status)
- Findings API works (/api/findings)
- Training API works (/api/training)
- Tasks API has import bug (Gamma imported 'db' from models — needs fix)
- I did the integration myself since Bob got blocked by mini cron jobs on GPU
- Bob eventually finished (15 min) but I'd already gotten it running

## Alpha Telegram Bot
- Token: 8461790746:AAErzX3-oXrHFxzMhvQLvCbA5irhhGNgD7o
- Configured as telegram:alpha account in OpenClaw
- Bound to mini-1 agent via bindings
- Pat needs to DM the bot and pair

## Telegram Commands
- /alpha through /hotel, /bob, /swarm, /panel, /stocks registered via setMyCommands API

## TODO
- Fix tasks API import issue
- Launch Spark App permanently on a port
- Finish CSM-1B voice install (remaining deps + HF token)
- Wire up more Telegram bots as Pat creates them
- Mini cron jobs need improvement — most just respond NO_REPLY, not doing self-learning
- Need to fix cron job prompts to actually trigger work (current prompts too vague for 20B)
- Bob gets GPU-starved when minis are running — need scheduling solution
